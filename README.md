LingoCode: Natural Language to Python Compiler #for now

LingoCode is an innovative command-line tool designed to bridge the gap between human language and executable Python code. Our core mission is to make coding accessible, fast, and fun for everyoneâ€”from beginners learning their first loops to experienced developers looking to quickly prototype ideas.

How It Works

Just describe the program you want to create in a plain English instruction file (e.g., example.lc). The system's powerful AI engine translates your request into runnable Python files. It automatically handles code generation, saving files, installing necessary dependencies, and execution.

Key Features

The true strength of LingoCode is its integrated self-correction loop. If the generated Python code hits a runtime error or bug, the AI automatically analyzes the error traceback and attempts to fix the code on the fly. This turns complex debugging sessions into a simple, automated process.

The interactive console provides a complete workspace:

run <path>: Executes the language-to-code translation.

fix: Manually triggers the powerful AI debugger to repair errors from the last failed run.

shell <cmd>: Run system commands directly.

cat <file>: View file contents immediately.

list & delete: Manage generated files easily.

LingoCode acts as your personal AI programming assistant, ready to bring your ideas to life without the usual hassle of syntax or immediate errors.
